# WiiKey Prototyping Board

Prototyping boards to assist testing programmed ATMEGA8 chips with WiiKey firmware. This can also be used as a standard run-of-the-mill modchip if you wish.

(Firmware and the tools to program the chips are included in the "firmwares" sub-directory).

## Design

The PCB and schematic was designed in KiCad.

## Materials

  * U1 - ATMEGA8 (PDIP8).
  * R1 - 1k resistor.
  * C1 - 100nF 0.1uF capacitor.
  * J1 - 1x06 right-angle pin header.
