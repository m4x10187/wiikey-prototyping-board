Prototyping boards to assist testing programmed ATMEGA8 chips with WiiKey firmware. This can also be used as a standard run-of-the-mill modchip if you wish.

(Firmware and the tools to program the chips are included in the "firmwares" sub-directory).

## Design

The PCB and schematic was designed in KiCAD.

## Components

  * x1 ATMEGA8 (PDIP28)
